            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A WORTHY SPEECH, Spoken in the Honourable Houſe of COMMONS:</head>

               <salute>Maſter Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the Way We are, we have gone as far as Words can carrie us: We have Voted our own Rights, and the Kings Duty: No doubt there is a Relative Duty between a King and Subjects; Obedience from a Subject to a King, Protection from a King to His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The preſent unhappy diſtance between His Majeſtie and the Parliament, makes the Whole Kingdome ſtand amazed, in a fearefull expectation of diſmall Calamities to fall upon it: It deeply and conſcionably concerns this Houſe to compoſe and ſettle theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ruining diſtractions. Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> I am touch'd, I am pierc't with an Apprehenſion of the Honour of the Houſe, and ſucceſſe of this Parliament. The beſt way to give a ſtop to theſe deſperate imminent miſchiefes is, To make a faire way for the Kings return hither; It will likewiſe give beſt ſatisfaction to the People, and will be our beſt Juſtification. Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> That we may the better conſider the condition we are now in, let us ſet our ſelves three Years back: If any Man then, could have credibly told us, That within three Yeares the Queen ſhould be gone out of England into the Low-Countries, for any cauſe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; The King ſhall remove from His Parliament, from London to York, declaring himſelfe not to be ſafe here. That there ſhall be a totall Rebellion in Ireland, Such diſcords and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers both in Church and State here, as now we finde; certainly we ſhould have trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the thought of it: Wherefore it is fit we ſhould be ſenſible now we are in it.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, if any man then, could have credibly told us, That within three Years Ye ſhall have a Parliament, it would have been good News; That Ship-monie ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by an Act of Parliament, the Reaſons and Grounds of it ſo rooted out, as that neither it, nor any thing like it, can ever grow up again; That Monopolies, The High-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion Court, the Starre-Chamber, The Biſhops Votes ſhall be taken away, The Councell Table regulated and reſtrained, The Forreſts bounded and limited, That yee ſhall have a <hi>Trienniall Parliament;</hi> and more then that, <hi>A Perpetuall Parliament,</hi> vvhich none ſhall have power to diſſolve vvithout your ſelves, vve ſhould have thought this a Dream of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; Yet novv vve are in the reall poſſeſſion of it, vve do not enjoy it, although His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie hath promiſed and publiſhed He vvill make all this good to us: We ſtand chiefly upon further ſecuritie; vvhereas the very having of theſe things, is a convenient, fair ſecuritie, mutually ſecuring one another: there is more ſecuritie offered, even in this laſt anſwer of the Kings, By removing the perſonall Votes of Popiſh Lords, By the Better Education of Papiſts Children, By ſupplying the defects of Laws againſt Recuſants, beſides what elſe may be enlarged and improved by a ſelect Committee of Both Houſes, named for that purpoſe. Wherefore, Sir, let us be ware we do not contend for ſuch a hazardous unſafe ſecuritie, as may <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndanger the loſſe of what we have already; let us not think we have nothing, becauſe vve have not all vve deſire; and though vve had, yet vve cannot make a Mathematicall ſecuritie; All humance Caution is Suſceptible of corruption and failing; Gods providence will not be bound, ſucceſſe muſt be His: He that obſerves the Wind and Rain, ſhall neither Sovv nor Reape; if he do nothing till he can ſecure the Weather, he will have but an ill Harveſt.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> It novv behoves us to call up all the Wiſedome vve have about us, for vve are at the very brink of Combuſtion and confuſion: If Blood once begin to touch Blood, vve ſhall preſently fall into a certain miſerie, and muſt attend an uncertain ſûcceſſe; God knovvs vvhen, and God knovvs vvhat. Every Man here is bound in Conſcience to employ his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt endeavours to prevent the effuſion of blood; Blood is a crying ſin, it pollutes a Land; let us ſave our Liberties and our Eſtates, as we may ſave our Souls too. Now I have clearely delivered mine own conſcience, I leave every Man freely to his.</p>
